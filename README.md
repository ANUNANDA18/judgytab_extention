## 🌀 Project Description  
JudgyTab is a sarcastic Chrome extension that watches your browsing habits and sends you *emotionally damaging*, completely useless popups based on the websites you open. Roasts included. Productivity not guaranteed.

---

## 🚫 The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People are browsing too peacefully. No judgment. No shame. No unexpected goat noises. We're here to ruin that peace. 🙃

---

## 🙃 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
An extension that watches what you're browsing and randomly notifies you with completely unnecessary roast messages and ridiculous sounds.  
Yes, even if you’re on GitHub pretending to work.
